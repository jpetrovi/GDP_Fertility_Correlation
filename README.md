# Correlation between GDP per capita and fertility rate
This repository stores code and relevant data for conducting an experiment of showing the correlation between GDP per capita and fertility rate(births per woman) for the year 2016.




## Prerequisites

Before running the code from the repository, following directories should be present: 
- `data/raw` - Directory for raw datasets from external sources
- `data/processed` - Directory for dataset generated by jupyter notebook
- `reports/figures` - Directory in which the correlation scatter plot will be stored

## Data Sources

- GDP per capita (current US$) https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD
- Fertility rate https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN
## Running the code

To run the code, it is required to have `python3.5`  and `pip3`. Also, following libraries should be installed with the command `pip3 install [library]`: 
- `notebook`
- `jupyter`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`

After the installation of the libraries, enter `jupyter notebook` command to start the jupyter notebook server and execute the code. There are two notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory that should be executed in the following order: 
- `01_data-preprocessing.ipynb` - Parses the input data located in `data/raw` and generates merged dataset that is going to be stored in the `data/processed` directory
- `02_data-vizualisation.ipynb` - Loads the generated merged dataset and displays its values as a scatter plot. The plot is saved in the `reports/figures` directory.
